# Virtualization
- Virtualization allows creating virtual versions of computing resources such as servers, storage devices, networks or even entire operating systems on a single physical machine.
- A software called a hypervisor sits between hardware and operating systems. It allows multiple OS ( called virtual machines / VMs ) to share the same physical resources.
- Each VM consists of 
	- Virtual CPU
	- Virtual Memory
	- Virtual Disk
	- Virtual network card
- For a VM these are looked like real hardware, but its actually simulated by hypervisor.
- ## Types of Hypervisors
	- **Bare Metal Hypervisors**
		- Runs directly on hardware
		- Best for 
			- Data centers
			- Cloud provides ( AWS, Azure )
		- Pros :- Fast, Secure, Low Overhead
		- Cons :- Harder to configure.
	- **Hosted Hypervisors**
		- Runs on top of an OS
		- Best for developers running VMs on loptops.
		- Pros :- Easy to use
		- Cons :- Slightly slower due to host OS overhead
- ## Types of Virtualization
	- **Server Virtualization**
		- Multiple virtual servers on a single physical server.
		- Use Cases
			- Running many applications on one machine.
			- Cloud Computing ( AWS EC2, Azure VMs ).
			- Testing environments.
	- **Desktop Virtualization**
		- A Desktop OS runs remotely on a server.
		- Use Cases
			- VDI
			- Remote work environments
			- Cybersecurity labs
	- **Storage Virtualization**
		- Combines multiple storage devices into a single local volume
		- Eg :- RAID, SAN ( Storage Area Networks ), Ceph
	- **Network Virtualization**
		- Abstracts network resources
		- Eg :- VLANs, SDN, NFV.
	- **Application Virtualization**
		- Applications runs isolated from OS.
		- Eg :- Docker, Kubernetes containers, APP-V, ThinAPP.
	- ## Benefits of Virtualization
		- Better Resource Utilization :- One physical server can run 10-20 VMs ( huge cost savings ).
		- Isolation :- A crash in one VM doesn't affect others.
		- Scalability :- Allocating more CPU/RAM is as simple as changing VM settings.
		- Easy Backup & Restore :- VMs can be snapshotted and cloned.
		- High Availability
			- Features like
				- Live migration ( moving a VM without downtime ).
				- Failover Clustering
			-Faster Provisioning - New VMs can be created in seconds.
	## Drawbacks
		- Overhead :- Due to virtualization reduces the performances.
		- Single Point of Failure :- If the host fails all VM are down.
		- Complex Management.
